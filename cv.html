                                            I have designed and created the branding and stationary for the company such as their logo this was made in Photo- shop and Illustrator. I worked with them again to create their website, which I made paper wireframes and mock ups for them to visually see the placement of each feature on the website. I then designed the rest of the website and built in WordPress where I used basic theme and used the back-end editor to further customise the website to the desired look and feel.
